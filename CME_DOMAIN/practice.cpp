A Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) allows you to make periodic transfers from one fund into
another managed by the same fund house. As with an SWP, you have to specify the instalment
and the periodicity of the transfer. The STP can be a useful facility to re-balance your portfolio
or to phase out investments in a fund over a period. You can invest a lump sum in a liquid or
floating rate fund and leave instructions to transfer Rs. 1000 every month into an equity fund.
