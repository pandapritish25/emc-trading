Differences in trading futures and stocks

stocks and future--> 
location --> they are traderd at an security exchange such as nyse but these are traded at derivative market such as cme group and they are governed by sec means security exchange council and these are by cftc

trading account --> stocks can be traded out of account via an broker means if you dont have an account you can also trade inside stocks but this doesnt work with future you have to open an future account and then deal with it and it is an straight forward process to open an trading account  just submit all documents and your account must have an min balance like it is not everyones stuff


trading unit shares vs contracts vs dividends
when you trade in stocks you buy shares you can hold shares for a particular time if the company is growing and can also pay company people also pay dividends to them who hold stocks but inside future they need to have a certain date and time after that you cant purchase

stocks can have an margin account eans that when you but a stock then you can go and pay for that stock inside the market and you can also borrow inside the market but here you cant do that inside the future exchange you cant borrow or have an margin ccount inside the market

there is a min fluctuatuin per contract means that if we trade inside a stock then there can be min fluctuation inside the exchange and that is known as tick it can be very small like 0.01 dollar 

inside usa certain level of protection is there for the stock trader inside the stock market for example if the market goes below points then an small amount is provided by seeing the bank deposits 
like stocks future cintracts have ticker symbols inside them and have been awarded with a particular symbol inside the stock exchange 

no borowing thus bothing to pay

contract specification -->
a future contract is a contract that enables us to but and sell specific sontract inside the market on a future date at the market enabled price


contract size means how much amount is to be brought inside tge market and is being determined by the stock exchange like wti crude oil has min of 1000 barrels of wti crude inside the market

tick size is the min amount of fluctuation inside the market means that
like wti crude oil you can have 0.01 is the tock size and you can call for 1000 then it is 10 dollar per tick
ticker symbol like stocks future contracts also have symbols inside the market and have also expiration date inside the market each has month and yeat of expiry

Certain futures contracts have price limits. This means the contract price has certain limits up and down. This is part of the risk mitigation process of the exchange and it protects customers, brokers and the exchange from excessive price movements beyond a certain range

this part has this has a certain level of ups and downs inside the ,market

while trading inside a future contract only variable unknown is price
while trading inside an futures contract the only variable unknown is price of the contract as it depends upon national value

	PHYSICAL DELIVERY VS CASH SETTLEMENT
no dobt alomst everyoe is invlives inside the futures trade inside the market but there is a catch and the catch is that like for example thre is 5000 bushes of soyabeans and all;anyone entering the market must know the entire things about future means that anyone entering the market must know the varous delivery mechanisme inside the market


cash settlement --> insted of acquiring a physical commodity we need to acquire inside a market there is no physical commodity exchange rathere there is cash settlement inside the market like yoy pay the price of that commidity and then pay the cash inside the market


may contracts needs to be paid about in physically like wti crude 500 needs to be settled in cash similarly other things like soyabean bushels 

Delivery process in physically delivered futures contracts

As future contracts nears its month those who are still holding positions inside the exchange needs and get notice inside the market the short position holder to deliver an underlying commodity must be given an notice to settle the delivery instrument is an shipping certificate and an warehouse certificate
a long twem trader must be preoared to take the delivery pay te delivery of the full contract infact less that 3 percent go into final delivery

First notice day (FND)
the first day the exchange can assign delivery to the accounts
first trading day only for cash contracts
To avoid deliveries, market participants, who are long futures, must be out by the close of the day before FND. If you are not flat heading into the close of the day before FND, you will be long the futures on the statement heading into FND, and the exchange can assign delivery.
