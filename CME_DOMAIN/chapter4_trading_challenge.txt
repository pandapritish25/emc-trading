In trading, Kahneman’s Prospect he thinks that once you have a position you can overcome your own rationality its human tendency to behave irrationaly when he . she thinks about profit and losses inside the market
its wise to have your hands on the paper means that once you have your hands on paper it would be not like the same to trade with your hard earned money inside the market . everything is safe inside paper trading because there is no chance of losing but here there maay be also a chance of losing inside the market

The Importance of Self-Confidence
self confidence is one of the most important things that you would require inside the market to stand out inside the market
now one of the students was working with arch inside the market and he saw that how other  student would react by seeing the behaviour of an particular student inside the market 
then intentionally the student working with arch told the wrong ans to his ./ her teacher and after that test 33% contradicted but they also told the same statement inside the market as told by other people inside the market 
human beings must have self confidence because they can be swayed easiy and novice trader are very suceptible to these because the fact is that they have peer pressure and also seeing them often go wroong 
it is not easy to develop self confidence inside the market but like all
successful traders were also once an novice trader inside the market means that all successful traders were also one novice trader and also they tell that there are 2 ways of circumstances one is look yourself at different scenarios and withstand yourself inside different circumstances and also ability to look yourself critically

The Mathematics of Trading Success
So, knowing that: (1) you could behave irrationally when it comes to profits and losses; (2) that you may have an entirely different experience with trading once you move from paper trading to real trading; and (3) that it is easy to be swayed from your plan by the crowd—what do you do?

no matter wwhere you study or where you are educated you can read more to get more like you read more get better gpa and also other things the more correct ans you have more correct you can get 
there is a point value inside each trade that matter how much profit and loss you can get from a trade by trading inside the market many successful traders target 3:1 or 4:1 to win inside the trade markjet
there is a size of win means that  whenever you are inside the market you havr to choose a size of win and lose generally successful traders have it in a ratio of 3:1 and of they lose 60% of time and also win 40% of the time then here is a twist and the twist is that 
risk = freq of win * avg size of win - freq of lose * avg size of lose

It's important to note that it's the combination of keeping your losers small and letting your winners run that makes this work. You can’t "wait and see" if your losers will come back to become large winners. That happens between rarely and never. If you're an investor, that might be a different story, but we're keeping this discussion to trading leveraged instruments in commodity futures.

Planning for Trading Losses
most of the time you lost because if lack of harmony between the trading person and also your personality inside the market 
if you begin to lose money inside the market means that you have to get out from tvhe market there is a chinese proverb inside the market of you  have an hole inside the boat then dont dig another hole to make water out from the boat meand dont add money to offset your position inside the  market 
 A huge benefit is that you'll be able to think more clearly after you’re out of a losing position because it's hard in the beginning to make smart financial decisions when you are under duress.
 however you must see 2 sides of a coin means that you must see doubling the money one and the other is by get wiped out from the market 
 
 Making It Real
 knowing the personality traits of successful trader cant make you successful inside the market but the fact is that you need to see that you are practicing daily and consistently inside the market 
 The problem is that we humans often know but we don’t do. For successful traders, this ability to “do” is innate and there is no issue. For most, however, “doing” is the challenge that keeps trading success elusive
 
 Who Are You?
 personallity doesnt affect how we move and respond inside an environment inside the market but here what makes an difference is that 
 you are better or not determinal inside trading or not and other things determine your successful trade inside market a personality profile challege is also there which helps people to maximise the performance inside the market and also to see that which style to take and also which style also not to take inside the market thenn once you understand  the natural skill set of a trader inside the market some coutious people beleive to have long term trading while other people prefer to have short term trading inside the market 
 thus by following someone you maynot be successful inside the market because this story is inclined to their market part
