Asynchronous communication-->
There is a log service that provides analyse monitor security and other services thus cloud provides us with logging service and applications here also provides with logging service and are always in contact with the log
Thus this is called as synchronous application

But what will happen if the logging service is not fine means that there is a delay inside the logging service then we can create a topic means a topic is a place where messages are stores and then whenever the logging service is ready then we can start taking the messages

Advantages of creating a topic --> always avialable
				   by seeing the topic we can increase the or scability or avialbility and all
				  
				  
		Cloud Pub-sub
		--------------
	Pub -sub is a reliable , scalable fully managed asynchronous managed service
	You can manage and can process a lot of queries inside pub sub each and every day
	pub-sub can auro scale and also low price to use
	
	like you can have sqs and also sns like you can go for pull and push message deliveries
	
	publisher can send messages to google.com
	one is pull subscription and the other is push subscription
	
	mainly it has 2 parts one is publisher and the other is subscriber
	Thus we can say that publisher creates a topic and sends messafes inside the topic and whenever the subscriber wants to take the messages then ot takes from it
	
	Step-->1 create a topic
	Step-->2 subscriptions are created to the topic
	if we have multiple clients those who pul from same subscription then we can use all
	
	Message can be delivered to each and every person inside the subscription
	
	
	Now how to create a pub-sub
	s1-->Go inside google cloud and then start type pub-sub
	s2-->create a topic using default pub sub
	s3-->enter into the topic and create a subscription(additional)
	s4--> after creation of topic then start with the publish message inside the topic
	s5--> now open subscription inside all other tabs means all new tabs
	s6--> now how to send the message that the message is acknowledged or not 
	
	
	
	Cloud Dataflow-->
	Pub/sub > dataflow > bigquery
	like it helps to transfer from one place to other
