Whenever you want to decouple an publisher from an subscriber then cloud pub/sub is used
pub/sub is used in a number of architecture

	cloud dataproc
	Its is a managed spark and hadoop service
	There are a lot of data prompts present and they are spark , pyspark , hive , pig
	
	inside data proc you can create multiple cluster modes and dataproc uses virtual machines
	and why to use dataproc it is because like if we want to use spark and hadoop then we would move them to google cloud and also some alternative is big query
	
	Now why data proc is used it is used when we have clusters such as dataproc and hadoop
	

How to get data into big query
Now here we can do 2 things one is ETL and the other is ELT
dataproc is a managed service and one of them is data studio


Streaming data
Cloud pub/sub --> receive messages
Now we have to process the data and we have to process it via cloud dataflow and also it is helpful
Now you have to load the data into big query


IOT code--> internet of things 
This is where you can manage iot devices 
This helps to send messages to iot devices and also helps to receive messages from IOT devices
Pub sub is also alowed to receive all the messages

Using datalakes --> 
Using big data solutions analysing ans visualising huge data solutions is known as big data solutions
means calculationg all the big data solutions and processing all the big data queries is known as data lake

Data ingestion-->
Like if we are streaming data then we can use pub-sub + cloud dataflow
But like you have transfer service then use gsutil and this can also be used
It also supports numpy and other things


	REST API CHALLENGES-->
Management of rest API is not at all easy and also we have to take authentication and authorisation and also all the things
Thus the solution is cloud management

APIgee API management--> Now its a complex product to have a complete life cycle means that design analyse monitor and also all the things

Cloud endpoints and also it helps to build a container and also create a google container
API gateway is one of the kind of factors like which has a simpler setup and also helps to make them
