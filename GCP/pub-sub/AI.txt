	Now google cloud ptocides a numbr of models on is one is cloud vision API
	Like if we attack gpus then w have to use onee of the things that is GPU but when we have to use machin learning worload then it is TPU
	
	Now what to do if we need to create an cross platform mobile application
	Firebase--> Build apps for IOS , android , and other things
	means like w have a number of applications inside an firebase and wee want to transfer it to mobile then firebase is used

		binary  --> ensure that only trusted peeople are there inside the containers
		security command center --> eeverything relatd to security inside the posture
		security is implemented inside the network center
		container threat detection helps to make container threats like binary executed and also other things 
		
		Cloud native --> helps us tp get the best from google cloud architecture inside the google cloud platform and helps us to use the elasticity inside the google cloud platform
		main goal is to increase service velocity and also collaboartion and also other things
		
		4 cloud services pillar --> one is microservice pillars
		one is microservice
		one is container
		third is that it is light weight means that it is faster to deploy and also helps in faster reliabikity
		container orchasteration--> kubernetees
