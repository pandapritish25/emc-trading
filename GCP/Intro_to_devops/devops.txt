			INTRODUCTION TO DEVOPS
			-----------------------
			
	Now mainly whar is devops and to what things it is related
	Mainly it is to get better at 3 things
	
	Now to build good software you need to create a good communincation and devops helps to make everything inside a single team
	
	Mainly there are 3 things one is feedback one is automation and the other is communincation
	and it brings all the 3 things together means that here there are 3 things one is business & development and the last one is operations
	Mainly bring teams together and also testing all the teans together and also they are much important
	
	
	
	DEVOPS --> CI & CD
	-------------------

Mainly what happens is that inside devops there are CI and CD practices that mainly means that
continuos integration and continuos deployment
continuos integration means that continuosly run it inside all the things and also deploy them inside a container

continuos deployment means that you must also deploy to check that it is working fine or not
and also continuos delivery means we have to make production costs and also we have to make all the production delivery inside it

CI & CD analysis means that
Static code analysis means that we have to check that if our code is having best practices or not inside the compiler
and also security code analysing software that helps to know that we are using our best practices or not

static and the other one is runtime means that during the time of running shall we make it or not
so mainly we have 2 things inside the CI and CD means static and the other one is runtime 


Now how to implement inside an CI and CD platform

Now you have implemented a code but the fact is where to store it here the cases of cloud storage repository comes means we have implemented all the codes now we need a repo to store and thus we can store each and everything inside the cloud repository
and it is also based on git


containter registery means that we have to store all the docker images all the things inside them

now jenkins and other things can be used to build

Now we have container registery and also cloud storage repos--> now what we have to do to run them inside this inside the cloud container for which we need a cloud biuld thus wwe have to use jenkins and also cloud  builder


	STEPS TO RUN AN APPLICATION INSIDE GOOGLE CLOUD

STEP->1 now store each and everything inside the cloud storage repository
STEP->2 now build a docker image inside them
STEP->3 store each and everything inside a docker or container registery
Step->4 deploy docker image to cloud run

store code in cloud storage resources
build a docker image and store them inside a container registery
now deploy a docker image inside the cloud run


	INFRASTRUCTRE AS CODE
	----------------------
now we need to create a infrastructure for an application code means that we can write a script to run the entire application inside them
now making the script you can bring changes and can also bring repetability inside your code and can also help them to start all the code inside
you can usse terraform to provision all the things inside google cloud platform


		OPERATIONS
	Mainly what kind of operations google cloud provides
	
	monitoring and alerts --> it gives you alert about all the thigs that are gonna scheduled and also we can monitor each and everything inside the GCP platform
	You can also make cloud looging which helps to make you see which cloud part is not running
	now about error logging is also there and also many kinds of logging is there inside google cloud platform
	You can debug an application and this is known as cloud debugging
	You can also trace the microservices inside the GCP platform means that you can also see which microservice is moving at what place

all exceptions are stored in error handeling



		SITE -RELIABILITY ENGINEERING
	
	SRE teams foocus on each and everything that is like latency , performance and all the stuffs means that it provides management , minitoring and all other things
	
	manage the service level objectivess
	minimise toil
	move fast and reduce cost of faliure

Now the best practices for SRE is 
SLI service level indicators means that the quantitive measures that can make the correctness
