		Baremetal cloud-->
	Now we have to talk about how to get rid of hypervisor
	
Google compute engine--> Whenever we start creation of a VM instamce then one thing is dine that is creation of multiple VM instances and each of these instances is being hosted at the host
Now creation of multiple VM instances at a single place is known as virtualisation
Creation of multiple VM instances inside one host it is known as virtualisation


Hypervisor is the one that creates the virtual machine and runs it like somebody who creates the virtual machine is known as hypervisor
but to use the hypervisor we have to give the hypervisor tax and we dont want to pay the fees
so to avoid the hypervisor tax we need to use wiyj baremetal

Baremetal--> Google cloud provides with customisable and dedicated software at an affordable price
Baremetal is free from google cloud , it is also preinstalled and also customisable and this also allows which operating system to choose


Google cloud VM ware engine
VM ware also provides virtualisation solutions and also provides different kinds of workloads
Mainly if we cant virtualise anything then VM ware allows us to virtualise each and everything and also provides solutions to it

Just connect the infrastructure inside the google cloud and then all your things would be migrated inside the google cloud
Now you do not need about anything means everything is being created by yhe google compute engine and alsos is better than other engines


Migrate compute engine --> you can migrate it from any place to any other place like google cloud , amazon AWS and also microsoft azure these are the 3 things that can be used and done accordingly

You can also move them all into batches like you can create a number of google machine clouds and can also move into batches like batch shifting can also be there
We have to also check that is to cut over the cloud and also move all things to google cloud.
