Relational databases --> maily OLTP databases
--------------------------------------------
Different types of databases there are many kinds of databases one is relational one is document
and inside relational there are also 2 types --> OLTP and OLAP
Now you have too choose which database to choose
it depens upon what kind of transactions is to be needed

--------------------
Relational Databases
Reltional databases means we have a predefined schema and other things like rows and coloumns
and also predefined relationship between tables and the variables taken
Like assume a relational database as student then it is ovious that the id must be in int and the varchar must ne in char and other things

As each one of them is related to each other thus it has a very good transactional data bases schemas
like all related databases here we can have strong transactional databases like if we need to change anything then it is possible to change in an easier way

--------------------
OLTP --> online transactional processing
whenever the data is there and it is a transaction related querythen it is known as OLTP
like here small amounts of data to be updated everywhere thus this is known as OLTP
small data reads and all are OLTP use cases
example bank and all 
Most of usecases is regional --> few terrabytes of data
cloud sql is one of best relational database --> few terrabytes
cloud spanner --> few pettabytes
--------------------

Step-->1 Press cloud sql on the console and press on create instance and then MYSQL
Step-->2 then give a username and password and then click on create instance
Step-->3 click on databases
Step-->4now your sql is created now go to database and create a database by clicking database at the left hand side
Step-->5 now go to overview and then connect the cloud shell by opening the cloud shell
but this would show an error and an api to be enabled for this click the link in the cloud shell and then click on the link and then click on admit api
now reconnect with databse again --> now it will run fine

Now you can come to the mysql database
Now you can do anything inside the sql like use this and that

Last Step--> click on all instances and delete them (also you have to disable protection)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Lets learn about cloud spanner
Step-->1 type cloud spanner and enable cloud spanner api
Step-->2 now click on cloud spanner and click on start free trial and then give the name
Step-->3 click on start insrance
Step-->4 create database now click on create data base and then start create table


create a table like this
CREATE TABLE Users (
  UserId INT64 NOT NULL,
  UserName STRING(1024)
) PRIMARY KEY (UserId); and click on submit

now a table would be created after submit
now go to overview and then click on users table and at last delete the instance


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OLAP --> online analytical processing
example insurance and analyse data like 100 of data are there 
and inside gcp big query is used
inside OLTP the data is stored in row format and OLAP the data is stored in coloumnar storage and there is cluster storage also


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		NOSQL databases
	inside relational data bases ther eis a fixed schema that we have to manage according to tables and coloums but inside the non relational databse we donot have any scheme like it can be anything
	NOSQL means not only SQL
	but here like there is no 100 percent guranter
	no sql is scalable and also high performant 
	
	NOSQL databases are firestore
	
	Cloud bigtable can store data upto 10 to 20 petta bytes
	
	
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
			FIRESTORE
	
	Step-->1 click on firestore and then enter into firestore and also enable the API then click inside the create database
	there are 2 modes there are native and datastore mode
Step-->2 select native mode and then choose aisa mumbai in region and then start database
Step-->3 Start collection
Step-->4 now start on collection and then put the document name and other things like inside the field name write the name and then choose the field and then choose and then start create

Inside a specific document you can also create all the things
Now if we want to query according to a certain type or anything then we have to use the indexes like if we want to use certain indexes then we can make all these
Like go on indexes then write the collection name and then on which basis you want to query 

One of the things you can do is that you can click on filter and this is  the best things
and then click on ascending or descending and then click on apply


You can also import and export data 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INMEMORY DATABASES
retriving data from memory is much easier than any other forms for which in memiry database is used as they provide microsecond data because you can retrive much faster
Cloud memory store
