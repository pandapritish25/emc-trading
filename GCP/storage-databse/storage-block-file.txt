			Block and File storage-->
			
Now mainly we have to mainly learn that what is block storage file storage and object storage
block storage --> if we want to connect our harddisk with the google cloud platform then it is known as block storage like they are persistent disk and remain constant

File storage --> when we have to share a file within many instances then it is known as file storage
Object storage --> It is mainly known as the storage inside the google cloud platform
whenever we store an obkect inside an google cloud platform then it is known as obkect storage


Block-->Like the harddisk you are having inside the computer then it is known as block storage because it is peristent 
	Like there are multiple block inside a cloud platform then we have connect one block inside one VM instance

Block storage are of 2 types one is the 
Direct attched storage that is the hard disk and the other one is a pool of shared resources that are persistant

	 
File-->You have created a file inside and want to share it with your collegues then it is known as file storage
       Like there is a file and you wanted to share it with your collegues then it is known as file storage

	Media workflows need a huge way to share the multiple resources and thus we can say that they need support for video editting
	and they need a shared resource where they can share all the resources in a faster way for which file storage is required

Block storage are of 2 types one is persistent and the otherone is the local block storage
so these are needed

Like whenever we create a block instance we can create a block storage which creating VM instances and the block storage is the VM boot disk
For accessing filestore --> Step1 ->go to search bar type file store and allow the API
			    Step-->2The go and create a new instance

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			Object storage-->cloud storage
			
	The google cloud storage is mainly known as cloud storage
Step-->1 Go to google cloud storage(type inside the search bar) && bucket is a kind of container to all the things you wanted to insert inside the cloud storage
Step-->2 click on bucket
Step-->3 The bucket name you give must be unique and no one would have taken that inside the world
Step-->4 Where to store your data inside it regional and other things
Step-->5 choose the default storage data
Step-->6The press create and now the bucket is being created and this is the overview now go to the folder inside downloads
then drag and drop all the files and the folder downloads is inside the computer 
Step-->7Then you can see that all the folders come inside them

	CLoud storage classes
	---------------------
Cloud storage classes are needed because there are a various of cloud files like media and all for which cloud storage is needed
Main work of storage class
1. First of all we have different needs to access all the classes one of
2.It is not necessary to be give equal priority to all the classes thus we need something to minimise cost and here where storage classes come like it manages the cost to less avialable classes

Now how it depends upon accessibility??????
Standard --> to be used everyday
nearline --> to be used once in a month
coldline --> to be used once in a quarter
archive --> to be used once in a year

Importance if cloud storage--> High durability and low latency and have less storage
Auto-scaling and autohealing is there

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Object management lifecycle
		---------------------------
	identify the objects basis of conditions
Object lifecycle management --> 
1.Set storage class means the if the age of an object is above x years then delete the class
2.delete if the class has > x years then delete the class
Now which transctions take place one standard regional or multiregional to coldline and native storage like from one to other
Step--> 1 go inside the bucket and then click on lifecycle and then you can set the liffecycle as per your needs
transfering the data base from on premises to cloud

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Transfer data to google cloud
		---------------------------
	Most popular transfer is online transfer --> use the gsutil inside the cloud storage
	Now do storage transfer service --> directly transfer to google cloud storage
	Now both the methods are good but use which service and when
1--> use gsutil when  the storage transfer is less than 1 terabyte
2--> and when it is more then 1 terabyte use storage transfer service as it is meant to store large service

Transfer Appliance -->if you want to transfer large data and the data is more the 20 Tb then you can go for transfer data because here durect copy paste is there so it would take less time to transfer
